        They approached a big gate.
        The Cathedral Of Secrets was in front of them.
        They let him in. The creatures talked
        for hours about the city and the story surrounding it.
        The boy realized he couldn't go back home,
        and he had to stay and become one of them.
        As this realization came to him, he tried to break free.
        Rushing, he managed to leave the Cathedral Of Secrets,
        having creatures right behind his back.
        He dashed from the tridents, fighting for his life.
        He made several turns through the alleyways 
        as creatures screamed at him.
        The boy managed to lose them.
        Thinking it was over, he felt relief.

        ... he noticed pain in his legs
        and there were scales all over his body.
        His feet turned into fins 
        -he knew that he will soon become one of the creatures.
        The boy anxiously rushed towards the shore.
        As his head peaked above the water
        he gasped for air but could not breathe.
        He returned under the water
        and started to engrave a message
        into a stone which was the closest to shore.
